Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($190,777 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

About how much did you receive (pre-tax)?
Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($237,822 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 35,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 69,342 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 72,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 70,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 74,900 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 87,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 135,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 145,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.
